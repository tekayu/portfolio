                <h2>Computer Basics</h2>
                <h3>What is a computer?</h3>
                <p>A computer is an electronic device that handles data, in a way
                    that can store, retrieve, and process it.
                </p>
                <p>It is made up of hardware and software, hardware being any part
                    of the computer that is a physical structure, and software 
                    being essentially a "set of instructions", that tell the 
                    computer what it has to do and how it has to do it.
                </p>
                <h4>What is the internet</h4>
                <p>Quoting MDN web docs, "The Internet is the backbone of the Web, 
                    the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible. At its 
                    most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which 
                    communicate all together."</p>

                <h2>GitHub basics</h2>
                <h3>What is github?</h3>
                <p>At its core GitHub is a version control system, basically a 
                    big save button for projects consisting of files and directories.
                </p>
                <p>In modern day programming, using Git is an essential skill as it 
                    allows one to not only save files locally but additionally it works
                    as a remote storage device, allowing the public to view files and 
                    collaborate freely.

                <h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>
                <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
                <p>At its core, HTML standing for Hypertext Markup Language is the language
                    that contains all the raw, unformatted data for any webpage. As im typing
                this right now its being typed into a HTML document.
                </p>
                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS on the other hand, standing for Cascading Style Sheets is the determinant
                    to how the web page is styled, changing options such as <span id="span_colour">colour</span>, 
                    <span id="span_font_styles">font styles</span>, <span id="span_font_size">font size</span>, and so much more.
                </p>
                <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                <p>And finally JavaScript, the "brain" behind your webpage, allowing manipulation of 
                    HTML and CSS elements after the site has already been loaded. This is truly how
                    you make your site feel interactive and alive.
                </p>
